# Shell
All the shells that I have made.

I do not take responsibility for any damage that occurs. You can only trust it's safe by looking at the code and that I use these

Put them in any of your bin directories for easy use.
## Compile C++
Useful tool for compiling an entire c++ directory, all the sub-directories, and so on. Just saves you from having to type it in. Made for ```clang++``` but should also work for ```clang```, ```g++```, and ```g```, but you would have to replace all instances of ```clang++``` with whatever you are using.

All you need to do is provide the name of the executable file that will be outputted.
```shell
#Example
$ compilecpp Bonanzo
```
